## 3. Performance Review

### Loading Times
- **Initial Load:** Large bundle size due to extensive audio files (20+ MP3s)
- **Image Loading:** No lazy loading for board tiles and avatars
- **Bundle Analysis:** No code splitting for game vs. room components

### Resource Usage
- **Memory:** Large Context objects storing entire game state
- **CPU:** Real-time PubNub listeners and state updates
- **Network:** Frequent Redis polling and PubNub messages

### Rendering Efficiency
- **Re-renders:** Context updates triggering full component re-renders
- **DOM Size:** Large chat history without virtualization
- **Animations:** CSS animations running continuously

### Scalability Issues
- **Database Load:** No query optimization or caching
- **Redis Usage:** Potential memory exhaustion with many concurrent games
- **PubNub Limits:** No message rate limiting per room
- **Server Load:** All game logic running on Next.js serverless functions

## 4. Security and Best Practices

### Vulnerabilities

1. **Input Validation Gaps**
   - **Issue:** Limited server-side validation for game actions
   - **Risk:** Potential injection attacks via malformed payloads
